You will use the NYC database you create in HW#5 for these queries.  Do NOT include the _id unless specifically requested by the query.   Use pretty() as much as possible.

1. Display the number of documents in the collection.
2. Display all fields (including _id) for documents that have an EventZipCode of 11201. Print using pretty().
3. Define a cursor using 2. and use the cursor method count to return the number of documents in the cursor.
4. Display the _id, AgencyName and AgencyDivision for two documents.
5. or all events that have a RequestID > 20151027500 and have an AgencyDivision of “Traffic”, display their RequestID. 
6. Display the EventDate for the events which occur in “Long Island City” or “Key Gardens”, and sort in ascending order on EventDate.  Write using the $or operator.
7. Same as 6. but remove those events that have no EventDate.
8. Print the _id, StartDate and ContractAmount for the document with the maximum ContractAmount.  Do not use pipeline aggregation. Instead, you can do with using sort and one other operator.
9. For all events costing at least 1 million dollars that have the AgencyName of “Taxi and Limousine Commission”, display their RequestID, VendorName and ShortTitle.  Write using find().
10. Same as 9., but rewrite using pipeline aggregation (see the slides from class).
11. Using pipeline aggregation, group the documents by TypeOfNoticeDescription to find the sum of the ContractAmount per TypeOfNoticeDescription.  Print each TypeOfNoticeDescription and the sum.
12. Same as 11., but only chose those documents with a ContractAmount greater than 0, and sort in decreasing order of Contract Amount.
13. Create a text index to search the Printout1 and name the index “text” field.     https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search  Count the number of documents whose overview contains the word "EMPLOYEE"
14. Using the index you create in 13, count the number of documents whose overview contains the phrase “EMPLOYEE NAME" (not the exact string).  
15. The same as 14., but use the exact string “EMPLOYEE NAME” 
Extra credit:  Can you rename the grouping attribute TypeOfNoticeDescription in 12. from _id to Description?
