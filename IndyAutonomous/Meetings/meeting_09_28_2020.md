# Task Assignment

## Tasks
1. Make a matrix which is the entire track, where each node is a point on the track. At each node, there will be a heading, velocity, etc. which is essentially the "gradient" that we want to use to guide the car 

2. GPS Follow task
    - Getting the GPS from the simulation, saving it to a CSV, and being able to read it in. Once you're able to read it in, to begin with, create a kind of simple follow technique for that GPS path. To start with, we can use the simple PID controller used in the first hackathon

## My Task
Creating the above matrix
