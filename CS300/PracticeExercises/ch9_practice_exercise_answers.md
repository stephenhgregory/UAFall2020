# Chapter 9 (Chapter 8 in old textbook) Review Answers

## 8.1
### Name two differences between logical and physical addresses.
- A logical address does not refer to an actual existing address; rather, it refers to an abstract address in an abstract address space. Contrast this with a physical address that refers to an actual physical address in memory. A logical address is generated by the CPU and is translated into a physical address by the memory management unit(MMU). Therefore, physical addresses are generated by the MMU.

## 8.2
### Consider a system in which a program can be separated into two parts: code and data. The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (instruction fetch) or data (data fetch or store). Therefore, two base– limit register pairs are provided: one for instructions and one for data. The instruction base–limit register pair is automatically read-only, so programs can be shared among different users. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme.
- The major advantage of this scheme is that it is an effective mechanism for code and data sharing. For example, only one copy of an editor or a compiler needs to be kept in memory, and this code can be shared by all processes needing access to the editor or compiler code. Another advantage is protection of code against erroneous modification. The only disadvantage is that the code and data must be separated, which is usually adhered to in a compiler-generated code
