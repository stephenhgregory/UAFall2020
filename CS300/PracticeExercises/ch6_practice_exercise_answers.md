# Chapter 6 Practice Exercise Answers

## 6.1
### In Section 6.4, we mentioned that disabling interrupts frequently can affect the systemâ€™s clock. Explain why this can occur and how such effects can be minimized. 
- The system clock is updated at every clock interrupt. If interrupts were disabled - particularly for a long time - it is possible that the system clock could easily lose the correct time.
Also, the system clock is used for scheduling purposes. For example, the time quantum for a process is expressed as a number of clock ticks. Here, at every clock interrupt, the scheduler determines if the time quantum for the current;y running process has expired. If these clock interrupts were disabled, the scheduler could not accurately assign time quantums. These negative effects can be mitigated by disabling clock interrupts only for a very short time.

### What is the meaning of the term busy waiting? What other kinds of waiting are there in an operating system? Can busy waiting be avoided altogether? Explain your answer. 
- Busy waiting simply means that a process is waiting for a condition to be satisfied in a tight loop without relinquishing the processor. ALternatively, the waiting process could wait by relinquishing the processor, and block on a condition and wait to be awakened at some time in the future. Busy waiting can be avoided, but avoiding busy waiting incurs the overhead of putting a process to sleep, and then needing to wake the process back up when the appropriate program state is reached.

## 6.3
### Explain why spinlocks are not appropriate for single-processor systems yet are often used in multiprocessor systems. 
- Spinlocking would not work for a single-process system because the condition that would break the process out of that spinlock can only be obtained by executing a different process. If the process that is spinlocking is not relinquishing the processor, other processes do not get the chance to set the program condition required for the first process to make progress. In a multiprocessor system, other processes run on other processors and therefore modify the program state in order to release the first process from the spinlock.

## 6.4
### Show that, if the wait() and signal() semaphore operations are not executed atomically, then mutual exclusion may be violated. 
- A ```wait()``` operation atomically decrements the value associated with a semaphore. If two ```wait()``` operations are executed on a semaphore when its value is initially 1, and the two operations are **not** performed atomically, then it's possible that both operations might proceed to decrement the semaphore value, thereby violating mutual exclusion.

## 6.5
### Illustrate how a binary semaphore can be used to implement mutual exclusion among n processes.
- Quite simply, a binary semaphore ```mutex``` could be initialized with a value of 1, and shared among all *n* processes. Then, any time a process wanted to access some data ```x```, the proces would first need to call ```wait()``` on semaphore ```mutex```, and after that process is done accessing ```x```, it would call ```signal()``` on the semaphore ```mutex``` again, like so:
```
do 
{
    wait(mutex);

        /* critical section */

    signal(mutex);

        /* remainder section
} while (true);
```

## 6.6
### Race conditions are possible in many computer systems. Consider a banking system that maintains an account balance with two functions: deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). These two functions are  passed the amount that is to be deposited or withdrawn from the bank account balance. Assume that a husband and wife share a bank account. Concurrently, the husband calls the withdraw() function, and the wife calls deposit(). Describe how a race condition is possible and what might be done to prevent the race condition from occurring. 
- One instance of a race condition could occur if access to the same shared variable ```balance``` was allowed without mutual exclusion. For example, imagine that the value of ```balance``` is 100. The wife calls ```deposit(50)```, while the husband calls ```withdraw(100)```. First, the husband's program calls ```withdraw(100)``` and accesses the current value of 100. However, before the new current balance is stored, the wife's program calls ```deposit(50)``` and changes the value of ```balance``` to 100 + 50 = 150. Then, the husband's program changes the value to 0, followed by the wife's program changing the value to 150. Finally, we see that even though the expected value of ```balance``` is 50, we end up with a ```balance``` of 150. The obvious solution here is to create a "lock" on the shared variable ```balance```. This way, any process that wants to access ```balance``` must first "lock" the variable before accessing/changing it, after which that process may "unlock" the variable.
